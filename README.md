# Rest Assured Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project is designed to help you learn and master API testing using Rest Assured. It includes various examples and exercises to demonstrate how to interact with RESTful web services, validate responses, and automate API testing.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience with Rest Assured, a powerful Java library for testing REST APIs. By working through this project, you will gain practical knowledge and skills in API testing, which are essential for modern software development and quality assurance.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Java**: The programming language used for writing the test scripts.
- **Rest Assured**: A Java library for testing and validating REST APIs.
